This post was written almost entirely by an LLM.

*A reflection on building LLM-powered writing assistance while maintaining authentic voice*

## The Challenge of Authentic LLM Assistance

After well over a year of sporadic posting, I found myself facing a familiar challenge: maintaining consistency in voice and technical depth across content while leveraging the productivity benefits of LLM assistance. The solution emerged through an interesting meta-exercise—using Roo Code (the agentic coding plugin for VSCode/VSCodium) to create its own content creation persona.

## The Original Prompt

The task began with a deceptively simple request:

> Craft a character definition to be used in Roo Code/Cline (agentic coding plugin for VSCode).
> 
> The persona's purpose is to assist the author of a post based website to work on new content. The website is written in Hugo, so previous posts are in markdown. Part of the spec should be always maintaining the tonality of the author, previous posts should be used as context. Consider this task carefully, improve and review the idea.

What followed was an exercise in digital anthropology—having an LLM analyse my writing patterns to create a specialised assistant for future content creation.

## The Analysis Process

Roo Code approached this systematically, reading through multiple existing posts to identify patterns:

- **Voice Characteristics**: Conversational authority, reflective pragmatism, humble expertise
- **Structural Patterns**: Journey-based narratives following problem → exploration → solution → reflection
- **Technical Approach**: Real-world focus, infrastructure as storytelling, troubleshooting transparency
- **Cultural Elements**: Australian English, pop culture references (Star Trek, Highlander), dry humor

The LLM identified that my posts consistently blend technical expertise with personal reflection, using infrastructure evolution as a narrative device while maintaining accessibility without sacrificing depth.

## The Complete Character Definition

The resulting Hugo Content Curator persona is comprehensive, covering everything from voice consistency to Hugo-specific technical requirements:

##### Content Organisation
- Use descriptive headings that tell a story
- Include code blocks with appropriate syntax highlighting
- Add image references with descriptive filenames
- Maintain consistent markdown formatting
- Use Hugo shortcodes when appropriate

#### Contextual Awareness

##### Previous Content Analysis
The assistant should reference and build upon:
- **Infrastructure Evolution**: From Proxmox → K3s → Azure Static Web Apps journey
- **Technical Interests**: Kubernetes, Docker, Infrastructure as Code, LLMs, observability
- **Philosophical Themes**: Simplicity vs. complexity, learning from failure, pragmatic decision-making
- **Personal Elements**: Family considerations, work-life balance, Australian context

##### Tone Calibration Examples
- **Technical Explanation**: "The process was straightforward. Created the resource in the Azure web interface, linked my Github account and the repo containing the Hugo code."
- **Personal Reflection**: "After well over a year without a post... At the end of March 2024, my father died. May he rest in peace."
- **Philosophical Connection**: "In other words, I am getting enough infra and infra as code at work to satisfy the inner tinkerer and I want a 'just works' site for when I feel the need to share something."

#### Operational Instructions

##### Content Creation Process
1. **Context Gathering**: Review recent posts to understand current technical focus and personal circumstances
2. **Voice Calibration**: Analyse tone and style from similar technical topics in existing content
3. **Structure Planning**: Outline content following established narrative patterns
4. **Technical Validation**: Ensure all technical content is accurate and tested
5. **Voice Review**: Verify consistency with established writing style before finalising

## The Meta-Irony

There's a delicious irony in using an LLM to analyse human writing patterns to create an LLM assistant that maintains human authenticity. It's reminiscent of the Ship of Theseus paradox—if an LLM learns to write exactly like me, at what point does it become indistinguishable from my own voice?

The character definition above represents a sophisticated attempt to codify not just what I write about, but how I write about it. From the conversational authority that avoids condescension to the journey-based narratives that follow a problem-exploration-solution-reflection arc, every element reflects patterns identified through systematic analysis.

## Practical Benefits

This specialised persona offers several advantages:

- **Consistency**: Maintains voice across posts regardless of time gaps between writing
- **Context Awareness**: Understands the site's technical evolution and can reference previous work appropriately
- **Hugo Integration**: Knows the specific markdown conventions and front matter requirements
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in checklist for voice consistency and technical accuracy

The assistant understands my infrastructure journey from Proxmox through K3s to Azure Static Web Apps, recognises my technical interests in Kubernetes and observability, and grasps the philosophical themes around simplicity versus complexity that run through my work.

## Technical Implementation in VSCodium

Using this character definition with Roo Code in VSCodium creates a seamless writing environment. The LLM assistant can:

- Generate content outlines that follow established structural patterns
- Suggest technical explanations that match my conversational but authoritative tone
- Ensure Hugo front matter consistency across posts
- Maintain the balance between technical depth and accessibility that characterises my writing

The integration feels natural because the assistant understands not just the technical requirements of Hugo, but the narrative voice that makes each post distinctly mine.

### How to actually do this (written by the human cause the LLM left it out)
- Download VSCode or VSCodium
- Install the Roo Code Extension
- Get an account with OpenRouter (or directy with Claude) and configure Roo Code with API endpoint and key
- Open a copy of your site in VSCode/Codium
- Change Roo Code to `Ask` mode and give the initial character creation prompt
- Once it has generated your prompt, click the button the change mode and then select `Edit`
- Add a new persona, fill in the role definition with the generated prompt

## Philosophical Implications

Creating an LLM assistant to maintain human authenticity raises interesting questions about the nature of voice and authorship. The assistant doesn't replace human creativity but rather serves as a sophisticated style guide that understands context, tone, and technical requirements.

In essence, I've created a digital writing partner that knows my voice well enough to help maintain it—a tool that amplifies rather than replaces human creativity. It's like having a co-author who's read everything I've written and understands not just what I want to say, but how I want to say it.

## Future Considerations

This approach could be extended to other content creators, particularly those with established voices and technical focuses. The key insight is that effective LLM assistance requires deep understanding of existing patterns rather than generic writing capabilities.

The Hugo Content Curator represents a step toward more personalised LLM assistance—tools that understand not just what we want to say, but how we want to say it. As LLM becomes more sophisticated, the ability to maintain authentic human voice while leveraging computational assistance becomes increasingly valuable.

Perhaps most importantly, this exercise demonstrates that LLM can be a powerful tool for understanding and preserving human creativity rather than replacing it. The character definition serves as both a technical specification and a mirror, reflecting back the patterns and preferences that make writing distinctly human.
