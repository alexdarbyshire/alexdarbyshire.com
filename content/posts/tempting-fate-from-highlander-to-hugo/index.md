# Welcome to my little corner of the Internet 
Several years ago, I acquired this eponymous domain. For quite some time, it was a single page with a video clip from the 80s classic Highlander. 

The clip, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqcLjcSloXs" target="_blank">which you can watch here</a>, shows Christopher Lambert delivering the iconic line, “There can be only one”, along with a whole lot of lightning and window smashing.

Over time, I started to get the irking feeling that perhaps one of the other Alex Darbyshires would take this a bit too seriously, follow through on the movie premise, and I would find myself in an impromptu sword battle doing my utmost to keep my head connected to the rest of me. 

So, I took the site down and left it vacant with not even a tumbleweed image to characterise it. It is time for something more… To any of the other Alex Darbyshires, there can be multitudes, and I am happy to be sharing such a many-syllabled name with you all. Please do not feel the need to continue fencing lessons, budo, or similar.

# What’s the plan, human?

Leveraging Cialdini’s principle of consistency, writing down one’s intentions makes follow-through more likely. The plan is to: 

Journal how I set up tech that I am playing with at the given moment. I find sharing to be an effective method for improving understanding of any subject matter. The process of articulating a concept makes the gaps in one’s knowledge more apparent and drives you to fill them. I would also like to give back to the internet at large where I daily seek out and grow from others’ sharing their knowledge.

Post the occasional musing on life. These could be a touch indulgent in their use of language and may contain traces of irony and dry humour.

Improve and journal the development of the site itself. Currently, it is written in the Hugo framework, self-hosted using a Docker-based stack, and made available via Cloudflare tunnel. I will do a short post on this configuration, then look to creating a build pipeline using Github Actions.
